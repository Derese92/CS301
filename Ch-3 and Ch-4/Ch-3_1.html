<h1 style="text-align: center;">My Story</h1>
<h2>Early Life</h2>
<p>My name is Derese Teshome, born and raised in small town in southern Ethiopia called Kibre Mengist. I am the third and the only male child to the family containing five children’s in total. My family, schools I have attended, religious institutions and the society had a great impact during my childhood period until I know which one is acceptable and not depending on my experience. I am lucky enough to be born from teachers’ family where both my Mom and Dad are teachers, they thought me the importance of education in every stage of my life.  </p>
<h2>School Life</h2>
<p>I had attended my elementary and high school education in the place where I was born and later joined one of the public universities in Ethiopia and graduated with BSc degree in Food and Biochemical Technology discipline.After completing my bachelors’ degree, I became a lecturer at Adama University one of the public universities found in Ethiopia under chemical engineering program and the family tradition continues. The desire to know about computers, how they are operating and how they are functioning fascinate me back early in my high school days and when I got the chance to use them to solve different problems my desire increased. I am just curious in nature and want to take every problem and come up with possible solution by writing some instruction on computer. Specially, when I had a chance to use different software packages for my research purpose, that’s the time I said to myself I must take part in this profession. The best experience that further dragged me to Computer profession is, I used to take part in different research activities in chemical engineering program and I have dealt with writing different MATLAB algorithms to solve certain problems, writing simple codes to monitor different processing parameters in different processes, I have also experience in using ANSYS software for design and simulation purpose in Chemical engineering discipline.</p>
